## Project Description

Given a ```.psd``` file, I was tasked with creating a "pixel-perfect" recreation of 
a given website. This showcases my HTML/CSS skills as I created pages with semantically similar HTML
elements for the ```<header>```, ```<footer>```, and ```<aside>``` elements while having
to create similarly styled, but differnet content from the index.html page to the 
post.html page.  

In order to get to ```post.html```, click on a 'Post Headline' on ```index.html```. This
website was created for styling practice and is not complete or functional.
